# Terraform_ELK (WIP)
Using Terraform to provision an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack in an AWS environment. The process typically involves:

Elasticsearch:

Deploying an Amazon Elasticsearch domain with desired instance types and count.
Configuring access policies, VPC, and necessary subnets for secure and isolated access.
Logstash:

Launching EC2 instances with Logstash pre-installed or using containers on Amazon ECS.
Configuring Logstash pipelines to process and forward logs to the Elasticsearch domain.
Kibana:

Accessing Kibana directly through the Elasticsearch domain's endpoint on AWS.
Setting up necessary visualizations and dashboards to monitor and analyze the logs.
Security:

Integrating AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to restrict access and ensure secure communication.
Optionally, setting up a VPN or VPC peering for safe access to the ELK stack.
Scaling and Monitoring:

Using AWS's Auto Scaling features to handle variable loads.
Integrating CloudWatch for monitoring the health and performance of the ELK components.
Using Terraform templates, all of these resources and configurations can be codified, versioned, and maintained systematically, ensuring a repeatable and scalable deployment of the ELK stack on AWS.
